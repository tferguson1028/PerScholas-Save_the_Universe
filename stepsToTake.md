## 1. Ship Generation
- Basic, generic Ship class that can work for player and enemy.
- Add variables to Ship class that both extending classes will use.
- Create specified classes for Player and Alien ships.
- Since Aliens are randomly generated, generate random values 
when constructing Alien class

## 2. Turn Based System
Game is turn based. Must wait for player input to continue.
### SO
- We need something that will catch input.
- We need something that will send the input to the main script.
- This needs to loop.
